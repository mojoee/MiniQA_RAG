### Project Summary: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System with OpenSearch and Python

#### Overview

This project aims to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using OpenSearch for document retrieval and the OpenAI API for text generation. The system extracts text from PDF documents, preprocesses the text, indexes it into an OpenSearch instance, retrieves relevant documents based on user queries, and generates responses using the OpenAI GPT-3 model. Here is a step-by-step overview of the project:

1. **Setup OpenSearch**: Deploy OpenSearch using Docker and configure it to run locally.
2. **Extract Text from PDF Documents**: Read and extract text from PDF files using the `PyPDF2` library.
3. **Preprocess the Text**: Tokenize the extracted text into sentences using the `nltk` library.
4. **Index the Documents in OpenSearch**: Create an OpenSearch index and add the preprocessed sentences as documents.
5. **Retrieve Documents Based on Queries**: Use OpenSearch to retrieve documents relevant to a given user query.
6. **Generate Responses Using OpenAI API**: Use the OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate responses based on the retrieved documents.
7. **Integrate Retrieval and Generation**: Combine the retrieval and generation steps into a cohesive RAG system.

#### Key Findings

- **Efficient Text Extraction**: Extracting text from PDFs using `PyPDF2` is effective, though the quality of extraction can vary based on the PDF's structure.
- **Preprocessing**: Tokenizing text into sentences using `nltk` ensures the data is indexed in a granular and searchable format.
- **OpenSearch Indexing**: OpenSearch is effective for indexing and searching large volumes of text data, providing quick retrieval times.
- **Integration with OpenAI**: The OpenAI GPT-3 model can generate coherent and contextually relevant responses when provided with sufficient context from the retrieved documents.

#### Suggestions for Further Exploration

1. **Enhanced Text Processing**: Improve text extraction and preprocessing by incorporating advanced techniques to handle complex PDF structures and clean the extracted text.
2. **Expand Data Sources**: Integrate additional data sources, such as web pages, databases, and other document types, to enrich the knowledge base.
3. **Advanced Retrieval Techniques**: Explore advanced retrieval techniques, such as using vector search and k-NN, to improve the relevance of retrieved documents.
4. **Fine-Tuning Language Models**: Fine-tune language models on domain-specific data to improve the quality and relevance of generated responses.
5. **Security and Authentication**: Implement robust security measures, including SSL/TLS, to protect the data and communication between components.
6. **Scalability and Performance**: Optimize the system for scalability and performance to handle larger datasets and more concurrent users.
7. **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface for querying the RAG system, visualizing results, and interacting with the generated responses.

### Detailed Code and Setup Instructions

Below is the complete and updated code for the project, including the necessary steps and modifications:

#### Extract Text from PDF Documents

```python
import PyPDF2

def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    pdf_text = ""
    with open(pdf_path, 'rb') as file:
        reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(file)
        for page_num in range(reader.numPages):
            page = reader.getPage(page_num)
            pdf_text += page.extractText()
    return pdf_text

pdf_texts = []
for pdf_file in ['path_to_pdf1.pdf', 'path_to_pdf2.pdf']:
    pdf_texts.append(extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_file))
```

#### Preprocess the Text

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

nltk.download('punkt')

def preprocess_text(text):
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
    return sentences

preprocessed_texts = [preprocess_text(text) for text in pdf_texts]
```

#### Index the Documents in OpenSearch

```python
from opensearchpy import OpenSearch, helpers
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Retrieve username and password from environment variables
username = os.getenv('OPENSEARCH_USERNAME')
password = os.getenv('OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD')

# Initialize OpenSearch client with authentication
client = OpenSearch(
    hosts=[{'host': 'localhost', 'port': 9200}],
    http_compress=True,
    http_auth=(username, password)
)

# Create an index
index_name = 'documents'
client.indices.create(index=index_name, ignore=400)

# Index the preprocessed sentences
batch_size = 100
doc_id = 0
actions = []

for text in preprocessed_texts:
    for sentence in text:
        document = {"content": sentence}
        action = {
            "_index": index_name,
            "_id": doc_id,
            "_source": document
        }
        actions.append(action)
        doc_id += 1
        if len(actions) == batch_size:
            helpers.bulk(client, actions)
            actions = []

# Index any remaining documents
if actions:
    helpers.bulk(client, actions)

print("Indexing completed.")
```

#### Retrieve Documents Based on Queries

```python
def retrieve_documents(query, index_name='documents', top_k=3):
    response = client.search(
        index=index_name,
        body={
            "query": {
                "multi_match": {
                    "query": query,
                    "fields": ["content"]
                }
            },
            "size": top_k
        }
    )
    return [hit['_source'] for hit in response['hits']['hits']]
```

#### Generate Responses Using OpenAI API

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

def generate_response(prompt, documents):
    context = " ".join([doc['content'] for doc in documents])
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"{context}\n\n{prompt}"}
    ]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=messages,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].message['content'].strip()
```

#### Integrate Retrieval and Generation

```python
def rag_system(query):
    retrieved_docs = retrieve_documents(query)
    response = generate_response(query, retrieved_docs)
    return response

# Example usage
query = "Tell me about Priority for client orders: order handling and recording."
print(rag_system(query))
```

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to create a basic RAG system using OpenSearch for document retrieval and OpenAI GPT-3 for text generation. By extracting and preprocessing text from PDFs, indexing it in OpenSearch, and using GPT-3 for response generation, we can build an effective system for various applications. Further exploration and enhancements can lead to a more robust and scalable system.
