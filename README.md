### Project Summary: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System with OpenSearch and Python

#### Overview

This project involves building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using OpenSearch for document retrieval and the OpenAI API for text generation. The system extracts text from PDF documents, preprocesses the text, indexes it in OpenSearch with k-NN vector search enabled, retrieves relevant documents based on user queries using semantic similarity, and generates responses using the OpenAI GPT-3 model.

#### Steps Taken

1. **Setup OpenSearch**: Deployed OpenSearch using Docker and configured it to run locally with k-NN vector search enabled.
2. **Extract Text from PDF Documents**: Used `PyPDF2` to read and extract text from PDF files.
3. **Preprocess the Text**: Tokenized the extracted text into sentences using the `nltk` library.
4. **Generate Embeddings**: Used `sentence-transformers` from Hugging Face to generate embeddings for each sentence.
5. **Index the Embeddings in OpenSearch**: Created an OpenSearch index with `knn_vector` type for embeddings and indexed the documents.
6. **Retrieve Documents Using Vector Similarity**: Implemented a retrieval function that uses k-NN search to find documents semantically similar to the user query.
7. **Generate Responses Using OpenAI API**: Utilized the OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate responses based on the retrieved documents.
8. **Integrate Retrieval and Generation**: Combined the retrieval and generation steps into a cohesive RAG system.

#### Key Findings

- **Semantic Search Enhancement**: Using Sentence-BERT embeddings significantly improved the relevance of retrieved documents compared to traditional keyword search.
- **OpenSearch Compatibility**: Successfully configured OpenSearch to handle k-NN vector search, enabling efficient retrieval of semantically similar documents.
- **Improved Response Quality**: Generating responses based on context from retrieved documents led to more accurate and relevant outputs.

#### Suggestions for Further Exploration

1. **Advanced Text Processing**: Improve text extraction and preprocessing to handle complex PDF structures and enhance text quality.
2. **Expand Data Sources**: Integrate additional data sources to enrich the knowledge base and provide more comprehensive responses.
3. **Fine-Tuning Language Models**: Fine-tune language models on domain-specific data to improve response relevance and accuracy.
4. **Security and Authentication**: Implement robust security measures, including SSL/TLS, to protect data and communication between components.
5. **Scalability and Performance**: Optimize the system to handle larger datasets and more concurrent users efficiently.
6. **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface for querying the RAG system and visualizing results.


#### hacks

* if there is problem with starting docker container sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
* make sure the password in the .env file can pass the regex (must adhere to safe password requirements)
* turn off security with plugins.security.disabled=true in the docker-compose file


By following these steps and utilizing the described enhancements, the RAG system becomes more effective and robust, providing better document retrieval and response generation capabilities.
